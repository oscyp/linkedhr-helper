No more wrong entered name if You plan to recruite somebody!

Scripts work in two ways:

* Indirect - when You're planning to connect contact by *connect* button
* Direct - when You're planning to send a message by *message* button - InMail option

It's checking the first line of written message. If contains the name of interested person, nothing is going to show, opposite if we enter a wrong name, then alert with *ok*, *cancel* buttons are shown.
