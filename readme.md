# LinkedHR helper - web extension for linkedin.com

No more wrong entered name if You plan to recruite somebody!

Scripts work in two ways (four for extended version):

* Indirect - when you're planning to connect contact by *connect* button
* Direct - when you're planning to send a message by *message* button - InMail option
* [Extended] MessageBox - when you're sending message via message box
* [Extended] Bubble -  when you're sending message to contact by popup chat

It's checking the first line of written message. If contains the name of interested person, nothing is going to show, opposite if we enter a wrong name, then alert with *ok*, *cancel* buttons are shown.
